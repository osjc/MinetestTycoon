[Basic]
Title: Bedrock
Type: block

[Description]
Bedrock is a very hard block. It cannot be mined, altered, destroyed or moved
by any means. It appears at the bottom of the world in a somewhat flat layer.
It protects the foundations of the world and if it could be somehow
destroyed, various things in the world would start to misbehave or even the
world itself would collapse and become inaccessible.

[Technical]
The area filled with the bedrock is used by the world fabric code to store
various metadata about the objects moving around the world. Removing a block
will clear its metadata, so if nodes at the bottom of the world would be
removed in any way, the metadata would be damaged. Thus the bedrock which is
used to protect the world.
