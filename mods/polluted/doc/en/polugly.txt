Title: Ugliness pollution
Type: Discovery

[Description]
This type of pollution, coming from an unknown source, causes the affected
areas of the world to look ugly and disgusting. The colors in the area tend
to be tinted to sickly green or nauseating whitish gray. Very few animal
lifeforms can handle the ugliness so most creatures tend to avoid these
areas. Your avatar fortunately belongs to the very few lifeforms that can
handle the ugliness so it is safe to walk in these zones or touch anything
found there.

However this ugliness pollution can infest particular lifeforms so
occassionally something walking can be encountered in the zone. However these
encounters are few and far between because the pollution tends to drive
lifeforms infested by it to exit the area and try to find more lifeforms to
infest. For example the zombies are actually human beings that were infested
with ugliness pollution.
