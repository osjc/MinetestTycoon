Strange thing I found in this cave. Sounds like metal, looks like a rock. A
damn hard white rock. Broke a dozen picks on it. Even tried the diamond one.
All the normal stuff needs just a few swings but this one ... I kept trying
for a better part of a hour and the damn thing won't budge. Not even a little
bit.

I am tired now. Tomorrow I need to make a new pick. Or several. I save the
diamond one for valuable stuff.

That strange white metal rock could fetch me a lot of gold. Only if I could
get some. Just one little cube of it. Oh, the dream ...
