They say weird beings live in these indestructible boxes. Look like they know
nothing. Not even about the blight and heat. Everything is burning at some
places. Other places look just plain ugly. Nothing lives there. No one can
withstand the plight.

But they don't know. They don't understand. They wonder at the simplest
things. What is so special on a stone hanging in the middle of air? Everyone
knows the drill, place dirt, place stone next to it, remove dirt. Easy,
peasy. Yet they look at it like it was the most wonderful thing since the
creation of the world!

But I don't know. Never been inside their box. My pick broke. Then the other
broke. The diamond one did not broke but did nothing either. And their door
is locked. Maybe. I can't find a keyhole nor a handle. Maybe it is not even a
door, just a wall shaped as a door to mislead simple minded folk like me.
But they say they saw it open, strange being out and close again ...
